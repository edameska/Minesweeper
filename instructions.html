	<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
	<div id="maindiv">
	<p>The objective of the game is for the player to clear a minefield without detonating any mines. </p>
	<ul>
	<li class="items">
		To begin the game, click on any square on the grid. Pray that it's not a bomb.
	</li>
	<li class="items">
		A number in a square indicates how many mines are near to that square. If the square is empty, you can safely click on nearby squares to clear them as well. Continue clicking on squares until you've cleared the minefield.
	</li>
	<li class="items">
		If you click on a square that contains a mine, the game is over, and you lose. 
	</li>
	<li class="items">
		Use the numbers to determine the location of the mines and mark them with flags. If you designate too many squares as mines, you may wind up marking a safe square as a mine.
	</li>
	<li class="items">
		You win the game after you've cleared the entire minefield! The time it took you to complete the game will be displayed, so strive to beat your previous records.
	</li>
	<li class="items">
		Try out different levels to challenge yourself and improve your skills.
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Try to enjoy yourself :)</p>
